# Configuration

To enable the module, place the following into OpenSim.ini:

```ini
[MathModule]
Enabled = true
```

# Support
Support can be obtained from SignpostMarv, either via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/SignpostMarv/TSU.CCIR.OpenSim.Math/issues) or on IRC where he usually hangs out in [#opensim-dev](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#opensim-dev)

# Notes
* Will not work on latest master, currently requires the [patch for enabling doubles and Vector3d in region modules](http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6255)
